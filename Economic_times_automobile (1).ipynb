      "    \"MG Motor, a new entrant in the competitive Indian car market, is adding a second shift at its plant from next month to help deliver the 40,000 Hector SUVs for which confirmed bookings have already been made. MG\\u2019s capacity addition by 50% comes even as the broader industry is struggling to clamber out of a protracted slowdown.\\n\\nOwned by China\\u2019s SAIC Motor, the British brand had earlier stopped taking bookings for its maiden product in India after receiving over 28,000 orders, with the waiting period for deliveries exceeding well beyond 2019. It resumed taking orders for the SUV late last month and increased its price by 2.5% on average across variants.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been able to get the confidence that our suppliers will be able to meet our additional requirements of parts and basis this confirmation, we will start the second shift from November onward,\\u201d Gaurav Gupta, chief commercial officer at MG Motor India, told ET. \\u201cBased on that timeline, we resumed taking orders.\\u201d\\n\\nWith a second shift, production will be increased to 3,000 units a month from 2,000 at present, Gupta said. The company sold about 6,100 units of the Hector during the three-month period ending September. Adding an extra shift will also lead to fresh hiring by the company at a time when many of its local rivals have been compelled to let go of their temporary workforce due to weak demand.\\n\\nThe Indian passenger vehicles market has witnessed a sales slowdown for a year now, with even entry-level car sales falling dramatically. Yet, most of MG\\u2019s customers are opting for higher-end variants of the Hector, priced around Rs 17.5 lakh on-road, said Gupta.\\n\\nBuyers are increasingly opting for petrol-engine variants over diesel for the full-sized SUV, he said, especially in the urban areas. The current petrol-diesel sales mix for the company is 50-50.\\n\\nMG Motor is going to stick with its plan of launching four SUVs in the Indian market within a span of 28 months starting July 2019, Gupta said. To cater to its increasing customer base, the company is looking to double the number of its touchpoints, including sales outlets and service stations, to 250 by the end of 2019 from 120 at present.\\n\\nTo maintain profitability of its dealers even as it brings more products, MG Motor has ensured assigning only one dealer principal to a city to prevent in-competition among its dealerships. Competition among dealers of the same brand in a city and the ensuing discounts to lure customers are the leading causes for profit erosion, ET reported earlier.\\n\\n\",\n",

Over half of this number will be through the sales of the Urus SUV, which the company launched in India last year, Agarwal said. The super luxury car segment in India is estimated to be about 300 units a year. Agarwal said that this number does not reflect the latent demand in the market.\\n\\n\\u201cIn terms of potential, we have not even scratched the surface. The super luxury car segment in India is very small. If you look at the size of the country, the number of millionaires we add every year, this segment is bound to grow,\\u201d he said.

The industry is seeing its longest ever streak of sales decline.\\n\\n\\\"We are preparing for best-case and worst-case scenarios ... worst case there will be more production and job cuts,\\\" said SIAM president Rajan Wadhera.\\n\\nCar and auto component makers have cut thousands of jobs and halted some production as the industry grapples with various challenges amid a broader economic slowdown.

Singh said he expects demand to gradually recover in the next three to four quarters.\\n\\n\\u201cI see a slow and steady progress rather than a radical change in the demand environment. We are still to see the churn on account of transition from BS IV to BS VI.

      "    \"MUMBAI: The Indian automotive market is heading to its worst halfyearly decline in a couple of a decades and the steep decline in sales by industry leaders is pulling down the market. These market leaders have shouldered the burden of the slowdown, which they hope is bottoming out.\\n\\nThe Indian passenger vehicle market is estimated to have declined over 25%, the commercial vehicle market 20% and two wheelers over 15%. This may pull down the entire automotive market for FY20 into the lower double digits.\\n\\nMaruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp and Tata Motors, the respective leaders of their segments, are the ones posting the steepest decline in top five vehicle makers in their respective category. Maruti Suzuki\\u2019s sales slid more than 25%, Hero MotoCorp\\u2019s contracted 15% and Tata Motors\\u2019 volumes slipped by a quarter.\\n\\nWhat has added to the pain is a prolonged nature of the current slowdown, which no one saw coming. \\u201cCommercial vehicle sales mirror the economic growth of the country. Various structural changes like changes in the axle loading norms and freight rates going down have affected CV consumption,\\u201d said Rajan Wadhera, president - automotive of Mahindra & Mahindra, who is also the current SIAM president.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last 2-3 years have seen a raft of regulations in emissions and safety along with increasing commodity prices boosting passenger vehicle prices by 15-20%. Factors such as the non-availability of finance, increasing registration and insurance costs have also raised the cost of acquiring a car.\\n\\nIf the rising congestion, increased adoption of shared mobility and rising cost of ownership impacted the passenger vehicle market, the rural slowdown has added to the misery of the price-sensitive two wheelers segment, which has already seen a rise of 15% in acquisition price. And as for commercial vehicles, it has been a triple whammy of axle load norms, efficiency improvement in GST and slowing consumption.\\n\\nWith core sectors shrinking, there is no positive sentiment to spend. Consequently, the sentiment against buying a car is very strong, says Wadhera.\\n\\nHowever, the head of Mahindra\\u2019s automotive business said car makers are seeing better retail pick up in September and October due to heavy discounts and festive sentiment. Companies are already seeing an inventory correction owing to the retail pick-up, said Wadhera, who feels that wholesale will continue to see a decline due to BS-IV to BS-VI transitioning and as inventories get controlled. The two wheeler industry is still under severe stress, led by high channel inventory, financing constraints, and weak consumer sentiment. Hero Moto Corp saw a 17% drop in sales. Experts say, Hero has not been able to correct inventories.\\n\\nHowever all is not bleak for some players. Inventory correction and focus on exports helped Bajaj Auto, which saw sales fall by a relatively modest 5.7%, the lowest in the auto industry.\\n\\nCommercial vehicles sales have been steeper than passenger vehicles. This is worrying, but a revival will happen from the fourth quarter when pre-buying kicks in, said Mahantesh Sabarad, head, retail research, SBI cap Securities.\\n\\nSome bold government announcements as well as a slew of festive season offers have auto majors hoping to turn the bend over the next couple of months. That some new launches such as the Seltos as well as MG Hector have resonated well with customers, has sparked hopes.\\n\\nRC Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki, said the passenger vehicle industry is heading towards the bottom of a downward cycle and sales are unlikely to decline further starting with the festive season. And if the market leader Maruti feels so, can the others be far behind in echoing this optimism?\\n\\n\",\n",

VG Ramakrishnan, managing director at consultancy Avanteum Advisor, said the immediate priority for Gupta will be to restore faith and confidence among alliance partners and employees.\\n\\n\\u201cGiven the global challenges, the big question for Nissan is, where does it get its next phase of growth from? The company had a headstart on SUVs and electrification, but has lost its way in the past few years. There is a serious need to revamp its product portfolio and make it relevant to current times,\\u201d added Ramakrishnan.\\n\\nRavi Bhatia, president at automotive research and analytics firm JATO Dynamics India, said the new Nissan management faces an uphill task with the brand being hurt from all sides \\u2014 sales, profitability, market share and branding.\\n\\n\\u201cThe company will have to undertake drastic cost-reduction measures \\u2026 to be prepared to invest in demand and future technology. Also, the company needs to be open to alliances to leverage its strength, especially in electrification, to share risks and scale,\\u201d added Bhatia. Gupta wanted to be a doctor.
